# SadieCat Learns to Code

[Live Site](coming soon)

This project serves two purposes:
1. To provide myself with learning exercise in building a React app with Firebase, Firestore, and Cloud Storage
2. To create a site where I can document my learning in blog posts. I don't expect anyone to follow or even read this blog; it is mainly for me to reinforce concepts and create a record of learning, growth, and progress.

Any user can visit the site and view all the existing blog posts in descending order without logging in. Users who log in with Google authentication have the additional permissions to create and delete their own posts. The admin user can delete any posts, and posts submitted by non-admin users must be approved by admin before they appear in the list of all posts. Each post includes a title, body, and optional image upload, and posts are automatically attributed to the author and timestamped with the date and time of submission.

## Technologies:
- React
- Firestore
- Google Cloud Storage
- Firebase
- HTML, CSS, Javascript
